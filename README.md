## Notes

I experienced extreme challenges behind the logic of the shuffle button, it was probably the most difficult
element among the different features implemented. I had to find a way to logically implement a randomizer that would alter the array of questions, without presenting any functional bugs. I had to reference external resources and search for help to overcome this challenge.
